# Exploratory Data Analysis - MSM Design

>  *What is Exploratory Data Analysis?*
>
> **Exploratory data analysis (EDA)** is a technique used by data scientists to inspect, characterize and briefly summarize the contents of a dataset. EDA is often the first step when encountering a new or unfamiliar dataset. EDA helps the data scientist become acquainted with a dataset and test some basic assumptions about the data. By the end of the EDA process, some initial insights can be drawn from the dataset and a framework for further analysis or modeling is established.



This repository contains various exploratory data analyses that Iâ€™ve created using Jupyter Notebooks.
